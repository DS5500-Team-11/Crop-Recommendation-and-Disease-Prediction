        <br/><br/>Gray leaf spot lesions that appear on corn leaves can negatively impact photosynthesis, leading to a reduction in the amount of carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The severity of the damage caused by gray leaf spot can be evaluated by assessing the level of leaf infection relative to grain fill. When developing lesions progress past the ear leaf during pollination, the damage can be more severe. This is because a decrease in the functioning leaf area can limit the amount of photosynthates dedicated towards grain fill, causing the plant to potentially mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill the kernels. To prevent this, it is important to manage gray leaf spot in a timely manner.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. To effectively prevent and manage grey leaf spot in corn, the main approach is to minimize the speed at which the disease spreads and increases.

        <br/><br/>The fungus Puccinia sorghi is the cause of common corn rust, which is one of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the United States. However, it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. While it can occasionally affect field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, it becomes severe only when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Although rust is a common occurrence on corn in Ohio, fungicide applications are generally unnecessary due to the availability of highly resistant field corn hybrids. These hybrids possess varying degrees of resistance, which reduces the need for fungicide application.
        <br/>2. Popcorn and sweet corn are more susceptible to common corn rust than field corn in Ohio.

    'Grape___Black_rot': """ <b>Crop</b>: Grape <br/>Disease: Black Rot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The black rot fungus survives the winter in grapevine canes, tendrils, and leaves as well as on the ground. In the spring, mummified berries that are still attached to the vine or on the ground become the primary source of infection for the upcoming season.

        <br/> 2. When it rains, a large number of black fruiting bodies called perithecia release microscopic spores called ascospores, which are then dispersed by air currents and settle on young, growing leaves. These spores then germinate within 36 to 48 hours in the presence of moisture and eventually enter the leaves and fruit stems.

        <br/> 3. The symptoms of infection become apparent after 8 to 25 days. If the weather is moist, spores can be discharged throughout the spring and summer, resulting in constant infection.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Proper spacing of vines and selecting a planting site with ample sunlight and adequate air circulation are important preventive measures. It is also essential to keep the vines off the ground and ensure they are securely tied to reduce the amount of time they remain wet and minimize the risk of infection.

        <br/>2. Maintain a weed-free and well-mowed environment in the fruit planting and its vicinity. This will reduce relative humidity and allow the vines to dry quickly, which can help limit fungal infection.
        
        <br/>3. Protective fungicide sprays can be used to prevent fungal infections. Pesticides such as copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram are registered for this purpose. It is crucial to spray during important growth stages such as when new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.""",

        <br/> 3. Spores are released during the rainy season between fall and spring, and pruning wounds that are in a dormant state provide potential sites for infection.

        <br/> 4. After pruning, wounds may continue to be vulnerable to infection for a few weeks, but their susceptibility decreases gradually as time passes.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Preventative measures such as delayed pruning, double pruning, and the use of pruning-wound protectants are more efficient and cost-effective in young vineyards compared to post-infection practices like sanitation and vine surgery, which are less effective and expensive when dealing with diseased, mature vineyards.


        <br/>2. Maintaining yields can be achieved through sanitation and vine surgery. During springtime, it is advisable to search for dead spurs or stunted shoots. During summer, when there is a lower possibility of rainfall, it is important to practice good sanitation by removing the cankered parts of the vine beyond the affected area to where healthy wood is visible. Following this, eliminate any diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and dispose of it.
        
        <br/>3. You might want to consider using alternative materials, like a wound sealant containing 5 percent boric acid in acrylic paint (known as Tech-Gro B-Lock) or an essential oil (such as Safecoat VitiSeal), as fungicides that are marketed for protecting pruning wounds. These alternatives are effective against diseases like Eutypa dieback and Esca.""",

Reduce the humidity surrounding plants by circulating the air in greenhouses and tunnels with fans, vents, and the sides of high tunnels rolled up. To prevent dew buildup on the foliage, keep overnight greenhouse temperatures higher than daytime ones. """,


    'Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Leaf Spot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/> Eliminate any sickly leaves. increase the flow of air around the plants. Make use of fungicidal sprays. Cover the plant bases with mulch. Avoid using overhead irrigation. """,

        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The most prevalent type of mite that damages crops of vegetables and fruits is the two-spotted spider mite. They are promoted by abundant nitrogen and dry, dusty circumstances and can have up to 20 generations per year. Using broad-spectrum insecticides interferes with the many natural enemies that help control mite populations, leading to outbreaks. 
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/> 2. Avoid applying broad-spectrum insecticides early in the season to other pests. Avoid overfertilizing. Population decline can be aided by overhead irrigation or extended rainstorms.""",


    'Tomato___Target_Spo': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Target Spot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. It is a serious condition that the fungus causes crops to lose their leaves. Low yields result from infection that strikes before the fruit has fully formed. In island nations in the Pacific, this disease affects tomatoes often. Both the field and the screen house are affected by the sickness.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/> 2. To enhance airflow at the base of the plants, cut down a few of their lower branches. As soon as the illness is identified, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been harvested, remove and burn the lower leaves. Keep weeds out of your plots since some of them could be the fungus' hosts. Avoid using overhead irrigation because doing so will encourage the growth of spores and infection.""",


    'Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Yellow Leaf Curl Virus<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The insect vector Bemisia tabaci transmits TYLCV in a persistent-circulative nonpropagative way. When the virus is in its adult stages, it can spread effectively. This virus's latent phase is 8–24 hours, with a short acquisition access period of 15-20 minutes.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>

        <br/> 2. At the moment, pesticides and resistant crop types are the most efficient methods for limiting the spread of TYLCV. Due to whitefly resistance to insecticides, insecticide performance is not at its best in tropical settings; as a result, insecticides should be alternated or blended to give the most effective treatment against virus transmission. Planting resistant/tolerant lines, rotating crops, and breeding for TYLCV resistance are further strategies for limiting the spread of the virus. The development of tomato plants that are resistant to TYLCV, like many other plant viruses, is one of the most promising ways to control this disease. """,




    'Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Mosaic Virus<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. In dry soil or leaf litter, tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus can survive for two years, while in damp soil they only last one month. Moreover, the viruses can last up to two years in soil-borne root debris that has been infected.

        <br/> 2. Even during the curing of tobacco, the virus can persist and transmit from cigarettes and other tobacco products to plant material handled by employees after smoking a cigarette.
        <br/> 3.However, the illness is typically introduced and transmitted mostly through human action. Seed can be contaminated and pass the virus to the plant. With routine tasks like plant tying, suckers removal, and harvest, the virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothing.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>


        <br/>1. Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease. Prior to purchasing, inspect the transplantation. Only grafts with no obvious symptoms should be chosen.

        <br/>2. The virus can persist for a long time in tomato root debris, therefore avoid planting in those locations. To prevent the spread of disease between plants, wash your hands with soap and water before handling any plants."""
